# Fortinet-Basic-Deployment
#### This lab simulates a Fortinet firewall deployment in a multi-segment network environment. The architecture includes core components such as a Network Operations Center (NOC), Local Area Network (LAN), Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), and Wide Area Network (WAN), with access to the Internet through a NAT gateway. This topology is ideal for testing policies, routing, segmentation, and firewall security functions.

# Fortinet Firewall Configuration Outline
1.Interface Setup
port1 â†’ WAN (171.1.1.x)

port2 â†’ LAN (SW_User, handling VLAN 100 & 200)

port4 â†’ DMZ (SW_DMZ)

mgmt â†’ Management access (192.168.1.x)

2.VLAN Creation
Create VLAN interfaces on port2:

VLAN 100: Admin

VLAN 200: Marketing

3.Policy Rules
LAN âžœ DMZ: Allow HTTP/HTTPS from Admin/Marketing to Web Server

LAN âžœ WAN: Allow internal access to external resources

DMZ âžœ WAN: Allow outbound traffic with restrictions

NOC âžœ All: Permit full access for management and testing

4.Security Profiles
Apply Antivirus, Web Filtering, and IPS profiles as appropriate.

Use SSL Inspection for outbound connections, if supported in lab.

5.NAT & Routing
Configure NAT on outbound policies from LAN and DMZ to WAN.

Setup static routes for Internet access through NAT Gateway.
====================================
ðŸ§ª Lab Use Cases
âœ… Validate inter-VLAN routing and segmentation

âœ… Simulate DMZ services and expose public-facing web server

âœ… Test NAT and firewall policies under various access conditions

âœ… Implement and assess security profiles in controlled scenarios
